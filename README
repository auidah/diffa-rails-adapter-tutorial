Development environment preparation
-----------------------------------

Dependencies:
* rvm ― https://rvm.io/
* phantomjs 1.6.0 http://phantomjs.org/ or from Ubuntu:
  http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/phantomjs (The packages in precise aren't
  currently sufficiently up to date, but the quantal package package builds
  fine on precise. Ceri has done this successfully and has binaries).
* bundler -- http://gembundler.com/ or `gem install bundler` in the rvm
  environment.

Getting this running should mostly be as easy as any other project, that is,
the usual `git clone git://…`; and  `rvm rvmrc load && bundle install`.
